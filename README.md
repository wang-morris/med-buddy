# med-buddy

An AI assistant designed for healthcare professionals, providing context-aware medical insights for everyday clinical decision making.

## Why I Built This

I created MedBuddy to help healthcare professionals streamline their decision making by providing context-aware insights. 

MedBuddy also allowed me to better understand the use of AI and API integration in web development, while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and ethical medical practice.
